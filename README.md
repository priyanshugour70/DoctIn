## What is Project ?

###### Title :-  DoctIn
```
Priyanshu Gour and Vedant Chandekar we both want to create a programme whose main purpose is to 
connect people and medical professionals. Since this app uses a map, if a patient is seriously
ill or in need of medical attention, the closest doctors will visit them at home and administer
care. mainly those patients who, for various reasons, such as being lame or having another issue,
are unable to attend a doctor's office. 

The programme also enables doctors to sign up and post about their patients' health and other
subjects. Furthermore, patents peruse the writings of doctors, and if the articles are helpful,
they are beneficial to patents.
